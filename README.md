# PickupBot for Discord & IRC

# Overview

This NodeJS Bot was design for managing Pickup games from multiple sources, such as Discord and IRC.

It was inspired by the old [Spydeee mIRC PugBot](https://github.com/spydeee/PugBot) that was used for UT99 games and it's implementing most of its features and more.

# Installation
Setting up a bot involve in the following steps
1. Create Discord Bot Application
2. Fetching bot source code.
3. Make a configuration file.
4. Buld & Run: Choosing whatever running the bot on a given machine or using Docker. 
    - Machine
        - Build
        - Run
    - Docker
        - Build
        - Run

## 1. Create Discord Bot Application

[Instructions](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token)

Get application client id and token - and put it to bot configuration.

To make bot join your channel, follow this link (with corresponding client id):
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=0

To get Discord channel id, follow these steps: https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-

Finding discord guild id (server id) is analogous. 

## 2. Fetching bot source code
If you're using git, use `git clone` command otherwise download the zip file and extract it to a choosen directory.

## 3. Configuration

Copy Basic configuration file from *conf/config_example.json* to *conf/config.json* and modify it.
At bot first initialization, it creates *conf/config_live.json* and copies some configurations (like text commands) which are configurable trough bot commands.
When bot starts it also creates *conf/persistent.json* file, which contains pickup current state.

```json
[
	{
		"sources": {
			"discord": {
				"enabled": true,
				"token": "[APPLICATION-TOKEN]", // Discord bot application token
				"clientId": "[APPLICATION-CLIENT-ID]", // Discord bot application client id. (described below)
				"guildId": "[GUILD-ID]" // Discord guild (server) id. (described below)
			},
			"irc": {
				"enabled": true,
				"ident" : "[IRC-IDENT]", // Keep one permanent id for one bot application.
				"nickname": "[IRC-NICK]",
				"server": "[IRC-SERVER]",
				"authName" : "", // authentification user (uses AUTH command and PRIVMSG Q@CServe.quakenet.org for quakenet).
				"authPassword" : "", // IRC authentification password
				"mode" : "+x" // additional IRC mode
			}
		},

		"channels": {
			"default": { // bind 2way communication
				"channelDiscord": "[DISCORD-CHANNEL-ID]", // discord channel id
				"channelIrc": "[#IRC-CHANNEL-NAME]" // irc channel name
			}
		},

        // users and they auth levels (Discord ids, IRC auths or IRC hosts).
		"authUsers": {
			"[DISCORD-ID-OR-IRC-NICKNAME]" : 10 // e.g. discord user id, irc name
		},

        // variable formatting of cross messages.
		"format": { 
			"ircText": "[DIS] <{$displayUsername}> {$text}",
			"urlAttachment": "<{$displayUsername}> {$attachmentURL}",
			"discord": "[IRC] **<{$author}>** {$withMentions}"
	  	},

        // predefined text commands (each command must be defined as array of strings).
		"textCommands": {
		},

        // default captain picking method. Possible values: *random*, *avgpick*. [default: random]
        "captainPicking": "random",

        // default pug rejoin timeout in seconds. [default: 30]
        "rejoinTimeout": 30,

        // allow players to play multiple pugs. If set to true, one player may occurs in more filled pugs. [default: false]
        "playMultiPugs": false
	}
]
```

Note for IRC: Some networks does enforce channel names case-sensitive, so that #tHiRd and #third are consider different channels, please make sure you use the correct sensetive name.

## 4. Buld & Run
You can choose to run it on your local computer or using docker.
### Machine
Prerequiesition
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) (Tested at [v12.22.1](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/)) (required)
* Python 2.7.+ (required)

Steps
* Navigate to extracted directory using a Terminal (Windows `cmd`, Linux: Termianl) and run `npm install` this will installed all neccessary packages bot depends on.
* Build: `npm build`.
* Run: `npm run start`
* In linux you can, both build and run togther using: `./build_run.sh &`.

May check *logs/log.txt* for errors. If bot does not work, kill that process and run `./build_run_debug.sh` to see the verbose output.

### Docker
Place configuration as `conf/config.json`

Build: ```docker build . -t utctfpugbot```

Run:

Default config path is `conf/config.json`.<br/>
Run: ```docker run --rm --name utctfpugbot utctfpugbot```

Run + Overriding default config path (replace [PATH]):<br>```docker run --rm --name utctfpugbot -e "CONFIG_FILE=[PATH]" utctfpugbot```

## Command Examples

### Add Custom Commands
*addcmd*<br>
<pre>
!addcmd secondChannel::info This is pugbot!::NEWLINE Another text.
!addcmd servers Some text with servers.
!addcmd anotherChannel::servers ::DELETE
</pre>

### Banning

There are more possibilities, how to ban players. The ban command format is:

```
!ban [playername|key] [reason:specified reason] [dur:ban duration in hours] [mask:irc host mask as regex]
```

If the player does not exist, you must specify ban mask for the hostname. Otherwise, it bans specific player by ID on Discord or by AUTH on IRC. If you don't specify a duration, then the ban is permanent.
On Discord you simply ban player:

```
!ban player duration:24
!ban discord:player duration:24
!ban discord_id:123456 duration:24
```

How to obtain Discord UserId ? Follow [this link](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-)

On IRC you may ban specific player - but the player **must** be online and **authed**:

```
!ban irc_player
```

Otherwise, you must specify regexp masks (make sure you have correctly escaped mask):

```
!ban some_player duration:24 mask:player\.users.*
```

Or specify more masks:

```
!ban some_player duration:24 reason:denied mask:player\.users.* mask:smt\.net\.dk.*
```

When you want update ban, type !bandef command:

```
!bandef some_player
```

It shows ban command with all parameters to further updates.
